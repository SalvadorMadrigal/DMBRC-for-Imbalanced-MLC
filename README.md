# Discrete Minimax Binary Relevance Classifier for Imbalanced Multi Label Classification
This repository contains the source code in python and the datasets used in the paper titled "Discrete Minimax Binary Relevance Classifier for Imbalanced Multi Label Classification." The primary goal of this project is to provide an implementation of the DMBRC (Discrete Minimax Binary Relevance Classifier) model that addresses imbalanced multi-label classification using k-folds cross-validation techniques.
